Feature: COLA Adjustment
  As a quote manager
  I should be able to add COLA adjustments in a quote
  
  # Scenario: Being able to add COLA Adjustments in the Adjust Revenue/Margin Modal
  #   Given I have created a quote
  #   When I visit the quote
  #   And I click on the Adjust Revenue Margin button
  #   And I click on the COLA Adjustment tab
  #   Then I can see input fields for COLA Adjustment
